A great script makes you curious about what the characters are planning next and make you put yourself in their positions and think: \\"Would I do the same as them right now?\\". In special, science-fiction creates environments that we, plain 21st century human beings, will never be able to experience. These environments many times allow writers/directors/actors to explore human feelings in ways that would hardly be possible otherwise. And on top of that, Andor gives us amazing scenarios and CGI, which constantly remind me how far technology has come to make us wonder.\\n\\nBut besides that, few things get to me as great dialogues and, particularly, monologues. I can safely say that Andor has given me one of my favorite monologues of all time. Few have caused me to feel the way I did right there, when I first heard it. In the 10th episode, Luthen (interpreted by the impeccable Stellan Skarsg\xe5rd), is confronted by another character. In a rather defying tone, he puts into question Luthen\'s contributtion to the Rebellion by asking:\\n\\n> \\"And what do you sacrifice!?\\"\\n\\nTo which a dark, introspective Skarsg\xe5rd responds: \\n\\n> \\"Calm. Kindness. Kinship. Love...\\n> \\n> I\u2019ve given up all chance at inner peace. I\u2019ve made my mind a sunless space. I share my dreams with ghosts.  \\n> \\n> I wake up every day to an equation I wrote 15 years ago for which there\u2019s only one conclusion: I\u2019m damned for what I do. \\n> \\n> My anger, my ego, my unwillingness to yield, my... my eagerness to fight, they\u2019ve set me on a path from which there is no escape. I yearned to be a savior against injustice without contemplating the cost and, by the time I looked down, there was no longer any ground beneath my feet.\\n> \\n> What is my\u2026 what is my sacrifice?\\n> \\n> I\u2019m condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else\u2019s future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I\u2019ll never see. Now the ego that started this fight will never have a mirror or an audience or... or the light of gratitude. \\n> \\n> So what do I sacrifice? \\n> \\n> Everything!\\"\\n\\nWhat a monologue, my friends, what a monologue...\\n\\nAs long as the screens keep giving us pieces like this now and then, I am sure I will keep giving them my ~~money~~ love.\\n\\nBest,\\n\\nY.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n___\\n\\n<Reminder />\\n___"},{"id":"/2022/09/26/introduction","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/09/26/introduction","editUrl":"https://github.com/yurirtonin/yurirtonin.github.io/tree/master/blog/2022-09-26-introduction.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-26-introduction.mdx","title":"Welcome!","description":"description","date":"2022-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 26, 2022","tags":[{"label":"welcome","permalink":"/blog/tags/welcome"}],"readingTime":0.425,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri R.
