Ptychography is a solution to the phase problem. Here, we aim at presenting a comprehensive summary of what Ptychography is, how it solves the phase problem and also detail different mathematical aspects of it. 

## Overlapping

## Magnitude or Fourier Space constraint

## Consistency or Real space constraint

## Algorithms

Ptychograpy algorithms can be devided into three different categories:

- Ptychographic Iterative Engines (PIE algorithms)
- Projection based algorithms
- Maximum-Likelihood refinement

### PIE family

$$
O'_{j} = O_{j} + w_{j} \frac{P^*_{j} (\psi'_j-\psi_j) }{ |P_j|^2 }
$$

### Projection algorithms

### Upgrades to algoritms

#### Probe Decomposition

#### Position Correction
