Coherent Diffractive Imaging is a hot topic! It's has been steadily developing for the past 30 years and to the newcomers, the amount of information can be a bit overwhelming. Herein I intend of providing a summary of this topic together with some of the mathematical details that I find not intuitive to understand (and sometimes hard to find at the literature) at first. 

We shall start with the more simply to understand "Plane-wave" or "Full-field" Coherent Diffractive Imaging technique, and then later dive into Ptychography and some of its details.

**PS#1:** These techniques can be use not only at the X-Ray wavelengths, but since this is the field I work with, my text might be slightly biased towards this field.

**PS#2:** This text is on continuous development! If you are an expert and think If you have any comments or a different perspective on any of the following topics that you think might ease the understanding to newcomers or to the general public, please feel free to contact me. I will be more than glad to update my texts according to the best explanation as possible!

Now, let's get into it...

## Lens vs Lensless imaging

Traditionally, imaging systems make use of lenses. Lenses are can be thought of as a carefully manufactured material that will 'bend' light beam to focus (or defocus) light in a precise way, so that it serves a desired purpose. When we think of lenses, we normally think of eye glasses usually made of, well.., glass. These lenses are appropriate for playing with visible light, that is, the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see. 

Nonetheless, other mechanisms can be used to bend an eletromagnetic wave and create what we call a lens for X-Rays, for instance, although this is not made out of glass. 

The problem is: lenses are, in general, not easy to manufacture. Especially for X-Rays. Furthermore, even if you can manufacture it, lenses can impose strong limitation on how good your microscope (a.k.a imaging system) actually is.

For that reason, some clever people came up with the idea: **what if we don't use lenses at all?** 

Well, yeah, you can get images with the use of any lenses. However, there is a trade-off. And that's what CDI is all about. For a microscope to work when you don't use any lenses, some other drawbacks appear that need to be solved **mathematically** which typical relies on **heavy computational cost**.

## The Phase Problem 

The phase problem is present in many areas of science and engineering [REF]. To understand what it is, let's first recall how you can write a complex number. Suppose we have a certain complex number $f$. It can be represented as

$$
f =  a + ib 
$$
This same number can also be expressed in its polar form:

$$
f = A\exp(i \phi)
$$
where $A$ is called the amplitude and $\phi$ the phase of the number

$$
A = \sqrt{a^2+b^2} \qquad \phi = \arctan(b/a)
$$

Now consider we want to measure a certain complex signal $f(x)$. The phase problem arises because, in some case, the measurement that can be done is an **intensity** measurement. An intensity is, mathematically spekaing, the product of the signal with it complex conjugate, which equals the absolute value squared of the signal's amplitude:

$$
I = f(x) f^*(x) = A\exp(i \phi)  A^*\exp(-i \phi) = AA^*= |A|^2
$$

Thefore, if you can only measure the intensity of a signal, you only have access to its amplitude, but not to its phase $\phi$.

For X-Rays, that is precisely the case. The electromagnetic wave that gets to the detector is a modeled as a complex wave, and the photo-counting detectors can only measure it intensity. 

Fortunately, the phase information is encoded in the intensity measurement and scientists have developed methods to decode this information. In other words, given the right experimental conditions, one can obtain both $A$ and $\phi$ from a measurement of $I$.
