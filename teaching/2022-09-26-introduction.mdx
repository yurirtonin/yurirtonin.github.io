This page is intended to host some blog posts that talk about technical and scientific topics that I believe might be useful to other people. 

I hope you can make good use of it!

<a >
    <Figure 
      data={{
            src: '/img/logo.png',
            alt: 'TheCube',
            type: 'image'
      }} 
    />
</a>

Which surface is the base of the cube?
