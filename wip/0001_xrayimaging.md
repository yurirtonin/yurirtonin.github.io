## What is X-Ray imaging?

In modern society, most people have at last once been exposed to X-Rays for medical purposes. If you haven't yourself, you probably at least know someone who has. The discovery of X-Rays were really a revolution for medicine. For the first time, one could now probe the insides of the human body without invasive surgery and the risks associated to it. One of the first X-Ray images ever produced was taken in 1895 by the German scientist Wilhelm Roentgen, where he took an image from the hand of his wife, Bertha Roentgen. He was actually awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery!

This first section intends on explaining how traditional X-Ray imaging works and, in future texts, we will cover the more complex and cutting-edge imaging methods, such as X-Ray coherent diffractive imaging (the topic of my work and research).

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

Let's make a small intercourse to understand what X-Rays are and how it relates to the most know form of radiation to us: visible light. For that, let's first take a look at the famous electromagnetic spectrum:

## Absorption Imaging

Now, in order to understand how X-Ray imaging works in the traditional sense, let's start with a pictorial view. Think simply of your hand being illuminated by a lantern and the shadow being projected in a white wall. The light travels from the flashlight to your hand and hits it. The portion not blocked by your hand continues to travel until it hits the wall, where you can see the non-illuminated portion as your hand's shadow. In other words, the portion of the wall that gets illuminated is bright; the portion that does not, is dark. 

Sounds simple, right?

Well, traditional medical X-Ray images follow the same principle. The difference lies mostly on the wavelength of the radiation in that case. Let's work with an analogy: think of a the goal new in soccer. If soccer balls were smaller, say the size of a tennis ball, it would go right through the net. So, for different types of nets, you need balls of different sizes so they get blocked by the net. 

For the electromagnetic waves we have something similar, but the size of the wave is measured by its wavelength ($\lambda$).
